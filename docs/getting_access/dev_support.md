# Software Development Assistance

!!! Beta testing

    Please note that the following description and service offering is currently in beta testing. This means we are actively testing the feature. At this time, applications for development assistance are not open, as we are exclusively inviting and testing this process with a select few projects.

We are excited to offer time limited assistance to support your software development needs. Our goal is to help you develop software that is not only robust and reliable but also capable of running and scaling effectively on High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure.

## A Collaborative Endeavor

This project is a partnership between our team and the scientists involved in your softwareâ€™s development. Together, we aim to create software that is optimized for HPC environments, capable of handling large-scale computations, and ready to meet the demands of cutting-edge research and industry applications. Your active participation and collaboration are essential to the success of this initiative.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following factors:

**Maturity of the Software:** We will assess the current state of your software to determine how developed and stable it is. Projects with a clear roadmap and solid foundation will be given priority.

**HPC Scalability:** A crucial aspect of this support is ensuring your software can run efficiently on HPC infrastructure. We will evaluate your software's current or potential capability to scale and perform on high-performance systems.

**Availability of Developers:** The availability and expertise of your development team are crucial for collaboration. Proposals demonstrating a strong and dedicated team will be viewed favorably.

**Time Requirement:** The time needed to provide meaningful assistance is a key consideration. We aim to allocate our resources where they can have the most significant impact within the available timeframe.

**Open Source:** The software must be open, with a focus on projects that showcase active community involvement, transparency, and contributions.

**Users:** We will evaluate the number of users, examining how widely the software is adopted, and assess its impact on the scientific community by analyzing contributions to research, advancements in knowledge, and overall community engagement.
