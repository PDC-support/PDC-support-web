## Viewing information about account usage

The PDC system usage page lets you view information about how much time different projects have used on PDC’s systems - either on a daily or monthly basis.
The information can be displayed as a graph or as a table and can be viewed at [https://pdc-web.eecs.kth.se/cluster_usage/](https://pdc-web.eecs.kth.se/cluster_usage/)
This information is also partially available using the SUPR portal, if you are a member of a NAISS project.

## Specifying what information is shown on the PDC system usage page

The top row of the system page is where you click on various options to specify the type of information that you want to view.
The currently selected options are shown in BLUE. Options in GREY can be selected by clicking on them.

* On the top row of the PDC system usage page, click on “Allocation” and scroll down to the particular project you are interested in.
