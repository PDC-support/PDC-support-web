# How to login from Mac OS

This section describes how to acquire Kerberos tickets and log in from different versions of Mac OS X.

**If you are using SSH with an SSH key pair, please refer to the page** [How to log in with SSH keys](ssh_login.md)

## KTH Mac OS X

In case you are using a Mac computer installed by KTH, everything
should be installed.
In case of any problems please contact [it-support@kth.se](mailto:it-support@kth.se)

Otherwise follow instructions below.

## Own Mac OS X

First get Kerberos tickets using default `kinit` (full path `/usr/bin/kinit`):

```default
kinit your-username@NADA.KTH.SE
```

Check that valid tickets exist:

```default
klist -f
```

You should get a similar output as the following one:

```text
Credentials cache: API:0E4B40BC-F22B-43B8-87E2-BA13538CF042
      Principal: your-username@NADA.KTH.SE

      Issued                Expires               Principal
      Aug 27 08:28:40 2023  Aug 27 18:28:37 2023  krbtgt/NADA.KTH.SE@NADA.KTH.SE
```

Now you are good to go:

```default
ssh -o GSSAPIAuthentication=yes  your-username@dardel.pdc.kth.se
```

In this case, dardel prompt should appear:

```default
dardel-login-2:~$
```

Check that tickets have been forwarded:

```default
dardel-login-2:~$ klist
```

The output should be similar to this:

```text
Credentials cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_18118_oZ0CMh5rsk
      Principal: your-username@NADA.KTH.SE

      Issued                Expires               Principal
      Aug 27 08:30:05 2020  Aug 27 18:28:37 2023  krbtgt/NADA.KTH.SE@NADA.KTH.SE
      Aug 27 08:30:05 2020  Aug 27 18:28:37 2023  afs/pdc.kth.se@NADA.KTH.SE
```

Notice these are the tickets in the `FILE:` cache in Dardel.

Other useful commands to check the state of your tickets are `klist -l`, which shows all caches, and `klist -v`, which shows more detailed information on the acquired tickets.

## Additional note 

In order to login you need to supply the option directly to the ssh command.

```default
ssh -o GSSAPIAuthentication=yes your-username@dardel.pdc.kth.se
```

OpenSSH can be configured with command line arguments or a configuration file to simplify the login procedure. The options in the configuration file are parsed in order. Create or modify the file **~/.ssh/config**

```text
# Hosts we want to authenticate to with Kerberos
Host *.kth.se *.kth.se.
# User authentication based on GSSAPI is allowed
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
# Hosts to which we want to delegate credentials  Try to limit this to
# hosts you trust  and where you really have use for forwarded tickets 
Host *.csc.kth.se *.csc.kth.se. *.nada.kth.se *.nada.kth.se. *.pdc.kth.se *.pdc.kth.se.
# All other hosts
Host *
```

Do remember to set the right permission on the file

```default
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config
```

After this, you can log in by using

```default
ssh your-username@dardel.pdc.kth.se
```
