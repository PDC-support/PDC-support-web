## General information

TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for machine learning, deep learning and other numerical computations using data flow graphs.

## How to use


# Instructions for using Tensorflow at PDC
Tensorflow 2.10 is available as a singularity container at PDC.
The container includes TensorFlow 2.10 with support for
AMD GPUs using Rocm-5.4.
In order to run the Tensorflow container, first allocate
a GPU node. Then, load the PDC and the singularity
modules.
ml add PDC/22.06
ml add singularity/3.10.4-cpeGNU-22.06
PDC containers are placed at */pdc/software/sing_hub**.
They can also be reached by invoking *PDC_SHUB*.
ls $PDC_SHUB
Now that singularity is loaded, we can for example open a shell session
within the container with:
singularity shell --rocm -B /cfs/klemming /pdc/software/resources/sing_hub/rocm5.4-tf2.10
The **--rocm** flag tells singularity to use the GPUs, and the **-B** flag tells singularity to
mount */cfs/klemming* into the container, thereby, making it possible to access files placed outside
it.
After the command, a prompt like this will appear:
Singularity>
Which means that we are inside the container, and now we can use **python** to run our Tensorflow scripts
from the terminal.
Tensorflow models can also be run directly without the need of opening a shell in the container using
the following command:
singularity exec --rocm -B /cfs/klemming /pdc/software/resources/sing_hub/rocm5.4-tf2.10 python3 <TF_script.py>

## Installing additional Python packages
There are some restrictions regarding singularity on Dardel.
Users cannot write into singularity containers, and therefore,
users cannot install additional python packages directly into the container.
So if you need additional python packages, you can add them via one
of these two following methods:
- Download the Tensorflow singularity container to your local machine where you have a local
installation of singularity. Then, update the image there installing the packages
needed, and afterwards upload the image to Dardel again.
- Install the additional python packages directly on Dardel, but outside the
singularity container. For example, in your home directory (the default behaviour with *pip*),
or in your project directory using the **--target** flag with the *pip* command.
Remember that if you install additional python packages outside the default python
directories, you need to update the **PYTHONPATH** variable with the path where
those new packages are before you run the container.
