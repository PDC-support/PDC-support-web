The NCO toolkit manipulates and analyzes data stored in netCDF-accessible formats, including DAP, HDF4, and HDF5, see
http://nco.sourceforge.net/


## How to use

To use NCO first load the module
```
module load nco/4.4.8
```
then the commands can be accessed with
```
ncap  <options>
ncap2 <options>
ncdiff <options>

# ncrename <options>
```
Using the NCO command by itself will also give some help on the options.
