The goal of the MAGMA project is to create a new generation of linear algebra libraries that achieves the fastest possible time to an accurate solution on heterogeneous architectures, starting with current multicore + multi-GPU systems.

## How to use

Load the module with
```
$ module load magma/2.2.0
```
The module prepends ``/pdc/vol/magma/2.2.0/lib`` to ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
and sets ``/pdc/vol/magma/2.2.0/include`` to ``INCLUDE``.
