We provide two installation - the original code (current version 2.1.0), and the custom version that is supported by plumed (http://www.plumed-code.org), confusingly named 2.1 (http://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.1/user-doc/html/_installation.html).


## How to use

For detailed usage please refer to the project's website: http://www-almost.ch.cam.ac.uk
